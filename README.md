### Thanks for Stopping By!

My name is Rem. I'm a security engineer, musician, NBA fan, and lifelong student. I'm currently building modern detection engineering systems, developing AI agents and MCP servers, and researching LLM Red Teaming techniques. My goal is to treat security operations like production software and automate as much as possible. Never stop learning, never rest on your laurels. 

"I am an elite engineer. I pursue technical excellence daily. I refuse to settle for a weak understanding."
